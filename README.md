# Heart-Disease-Prediction-System
Heart Disease prediction has been of the most complicated tasks in medical field in recent times. In the modern era, approximately one person dies per minute due to heart disease. Data science plays a major role in processing the huge amount of data involved in the field of healthcare. Heart disease prediction being a very complex task, arises the need to automate the process of prediction to avoid risks associated with it and alert the patient well in advance.
Heart diseases have been the leading cause of death for many years now. The most important behavioral risk factors of heart disease are unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and alcohol. The effects of behavioral risk factors may show up in individuals as raised blood pressure, raised blood glucose, raised blood lipids, and overweight and obesity. 
The main goal of the project is to detect whether the patients have heart disease or not using different attributes. Also, this work predicts the chances of Heart Disease and classify patient's risk level by implementing different techniques such as Linear Discriminamt Analaysis (LDA), Quadrant Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Knn, SVM, RF and GBM and present a detailed comparative study by analyzing the performance of different machine learning algorithms.
